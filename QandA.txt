IPTV vs TV
TV is using a dedicated infrastructure, it is usually sends all channels and the receiver display only the channel he wishes.
IPTV is using the Ethernet infrastructure and IP protocol to transmit the channel to the consumer. The consumer chose the desire channel and request this from the server, which then send only this channel to him.

Real time IPTV
To implement real time IPTV in an efficient way we can use IGMP.
We can apply this method becuase we have dedicated routers between each client and the server.
The dedicated routers are a part of a private dedicated network.

In this type of application we have the ability to stream via multicast.
in this way we economize bandwidth. multicast streams sends traffic to a given port only when those traffic are requested.
**the multicast stream sits at the backbone of the network and they don't come down the segment or to every device untill he is requested.
**read chapter 2 for information about video streaming and CDNs.

**TCP or UDP segments are carried as IP payload. 
**the job of the link-layer switch is to carry datagrams between hosts and routers; a switch
does this job transparently, that is, without the host or router having to explicitly
address the frame to the intervening switch
**However, sometimes a sending adapter does want all the other adapters on the
LAN to receive and process the frame it is about to send. In this case, the sending
adapter inserts a special MAC broadcast address into the destination address field
of the frame.
**MAC addresses is just like your ID, even when you want to get a IP address from the DHCP 
you have to introduce yourself as someone.. this is by MAC address.
Also, MAC enables you to use whatever L3 protocol you choose, not only IP, as power of layering.
